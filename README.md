Drawing Economic Conclusions on the Indian Stock Market - By   Devang Garg, Prathamesh Aundhakar & Harsh Bhaskar


Predicting complex stock market trends is crucial yet challenging due to diverse influencing factors. Feature Selection, using machine learning, filters irrelevant variables from data for effective analysis. We apply Sequential Forward Search, Boruta, and Boruta-SHAP on stock and commodities markets, unveiling crucial factors. Results from the Long Short-Term Model enable economic insights and question existing theories. Markets' black-box complexity fuels extensive research. Economics, rich in theories but limited proof, is ripe for ML-driven questioning. SFS, Boruta, and Boruta-SHAP are employed, with compared accuracies. This study bridges finance, AI, and economics, illuminating market behavior intricacies and validating or reshaping economic theories.
